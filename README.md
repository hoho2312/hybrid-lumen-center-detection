# hybrid-lumen-center-detection
A lumen center estimation method based on deep learning (LCD model) and traditional CV techniques

Paper has been submitted to IROS 2023 with title: Autonomous Robotic Colonoscope Navigation Framework Based on a Hybrid Lumen Center Detection Model

This repo consists of the trained LCD model for lumen contour detection, the code for estimation (which is the algorithm proposed in the submitted paper)

The lumen contour dataset (created from randomly selected subset images of LDPolypVideo dataset) can be found on:

To train the LCD model, please refer to the repo of LCD or DexiNed for further reading.
